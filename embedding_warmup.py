"""Embed memories when they are STORED, not when they are asked about.

semantic_recall embeds each candidate's text at query time. The vectors are cached, so the cost is
paid once — but it is paid by whoever asks the first question after a batch of memories arrives, and
on CPU that is seconds to minutes. Writing is the right moment: it happens once per memory, in the
background of a conversation the user is already having.

The text embedded here is exactly what the recall path will hash (the engram's FTS text, first 500
characters), so a warmed memory is a cache hit rather than a near miss.
