"""Does gathering by ENTITY beat gathering by similarity? Offline, no API.

The product now indexes entity -> its memories (entity_timeline.py). The claim behind it is that
questions about one thing ("what happened to the auth module", "what did I buy before the air
fryer") need that thing's whole history, which similarity ranking only partly returns.

This measures the claim on dev2 with the labels we already have: what share of the answer-bearing
turns reaches the reader's packet under

    current   top-15 question-relevant events -> their source turns (what ships today)
    entity    events whose subject/object matches an entity the planner named -> their source turns
    union     both

Same packet mechanics either way, so the only difference is how the events were chosen.
