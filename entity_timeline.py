"""Per-entity change history: "what happened to THIS thing, in order".

Retrieval by similarity answers "what is related to this question". It does not answer "what has
happened to the auth module", because the four decisions about it sit in four different sessions and
only the closest one or two come back. The failures that kept surviving every retrieval fix were of
exactly this shape — which came first, what is the current value, how many times in total.

So the store keeps a second index beside the memories: entity -> its memories, oldest first, with
superseded ones marked. No graph engine and no traversal: Zep's multi-hop machinery answers questions
we never actually failed. The entity NAMES come from the model that wrote the memory (naming is a
language judgement); this module only groups, orders and reads.
