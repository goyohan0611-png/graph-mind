"""Why do untuned multi-session questions fail? Offline, free: does the packet hold every answer
session, under a few packet shapes?

The full 500 run (runs/graph-v6.4-full500) scored multi-session 29/32 on the tuned dev2 questions and
41/89 on the rest. On dev2 every packet already held all its answer sessions, so retrieval changes
measured there could not show a gain. Here the untuned multi-session questions are split in two by
sha256 of the id: choices are made on the "tune" half and only then read on the "confirm" half.
