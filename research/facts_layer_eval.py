"""Does the facts layer help, or hurt? The same questions answered without and with facts.

In real use the model the user talks to records a fact with `about` and `attribute` as the user
mentions it. Here gpt-5-mini plays that model: it reads each haystack's user turns in order, ten
sessions at a time, sees the facts it recorded so far (as brain_context would show them), and
records new ones the way brain_remember's docstring asks. The facts are saved dated to their
session, then the shipped packet, reader and official judge run twice over the same questions:
off (conversation only, as today) and on (conversation plus facts).

Only the question types the layer is for: knowledge-update (78, the value changed) and
single-session-preference (30). Knowledge-update already scores 68/72 on the full-500 run, so the
question is mostly whether wrongly recorded facts make answers worse.

    OPENAI_API_KEY=... python facts_layer_eval.py extract    # the stand-in model records facts
    python facts_layer_eval.py spans                          # packets off and on (offline)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=... python facts_layer_eval.py answer     # reader + judge, off vs on

- about: who or what ("me" for the user, else a name like "Kongi" or "my sister").
