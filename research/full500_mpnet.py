"""All 500 packets on the 0.9.10 model (multilingual mpnet int8), for the headline measured on
MiniLM (88.8%). Embedding all of LongMemEval_S takes longer than one CI job: progress and vectors
live in bench/.cache, which the bench workflow saves after every run, so dispatching it again
continues where it stopped. Then answers and judging run locally:

    gh workflow run bench -f research=full500_mpnet.py         # until it prints "500 packets"
    gh workflow run bench --ref exp/x -f research="full500_mpnet.py x"   # an experiment arm
    cd research && OPENAI_API_KEY=... python product_answer_eval.py answer \
        --out runs/graph-v9.14-full500-mpnet8 --ids runs/graph-v7.0-full500-30/ids.json
