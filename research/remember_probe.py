"""Does the model decide well, by itself, what goes into the facts layer? Old vs new instructions.

In apps whose conversations are captured anyway (Claude Code, Codex), the model is told when to
call brain_remember (CAPTURED_NOTE). Keyword rules cannot cover how people say things, so the
judgement is the model's. Codex reads each instruction text and 32 user messages (Korean and
English, half that should be saved, half that should not) and says whether it would call
brain_remember. One call at a time.
