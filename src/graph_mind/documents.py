"""Project documents (specs, design notes, READMEs) kept beside the conversations.

`turnbook docs add <folder>` lists a folder in ~/.graph-mind/documents.json; the capture service
reads its Markdown and text files, cuts them at headings, and stores each section as a turn
(client "document", role "document"), so the word and meaning searches, the re-ranker and the
packets need nothing new. A section is stored once per distinct text: an edited section is a new
turn, and the version it replaced stays, marked with when it was replaced (document_replaced),
so "what did the spec say before?" has an answer and the newer text wins.
