A captured turn or memory lives in its store, in that store's word index, and as an engram in the
associative index; all three go. In the shared log its lines go too: Postgres rows are deleted, a
folder's lines are blanked in place (same length, so other PCs' read offsets stay valid). Then a
"forget" record listing the ids, never the phrase, tells every other PC to erase its own copies.

Not covered: the AI app's own transcript (Claude Code keeps ~/.claude/projects/*.jsonl) and the
embedding vectors, which are numbers keyed by a hash and hold no text.
