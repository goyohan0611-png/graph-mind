"""Conversation text, compressed where it is stored.

A turn's text is kept zlib-compressed in `content_z` once it is long enough for that to pay
(`content_redacted` is then ''); short turns stay plain. Measured on 20,000 LongMemEval turns:
about half the size, and unpacking the 30 turns of one question takes under a millisecond.
The word-search index keeps the plain words, so search is unchanged.
