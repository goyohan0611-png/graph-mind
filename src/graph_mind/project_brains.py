"""Project brains: what a team's AIs need to know about a project, apart from personal memory.

Everyone has a private brain (conversations, notes, trial and error), saved automatically on
their own PCs. Every project has a shared brain, and it holds only what someone explicitly
publishes: checkpoints (decision, progress, blocker, next action, artifact, release) with their
context (what changed, where, why, how it was verified, what is left) and links to where the
work itself is: a git commit at the stage it reached, a Slack message, a document in a drive.
Files and conversations about them stay in those tools; the shared brain is how another
person's AI picks the work up. Nothing in this module reads the conversation or memory stores,
so no misfiled scope can leak a conversation into a project; `source_refs` carry local ids only.

Code is not copied: a git folder is linked by repository, branch and commit, and recorded at
the stage it really reached (committed, pushed, pr_open, merged, released), so "done" is never
claimed for a commit that only exists on one PC.

Project brains are optional: personal memory is the product, and a team shares only what it
chooses to. A project lives on a Postgres hub (a PC, server or NAS; office network or Tailscale),
or on this PC alone. On a hub, whoever runs it runs the server: they give a person an account
(`graph-mind-hub add-user`), a login that cannot reach anyone's personal memory and sees only the
projects it is a member of. Each project is its own
schema with its own groups and key. Whoever creates a project owns it; only owners add members
(owner, editor or viewer), set the instructions or take others' checkpoints back. Every action,
reads included, is audited.
