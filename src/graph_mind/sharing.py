"""One brain across devices: the shared folder holds the memory, each machine holds an index.

A database file in a synced folder breaks: OneDrive and Dropbox copy files, they do not order two
machines' writes. So the memory itself is kept as plain append-only text in the shared folder, and
every machine builds its own SQLite index from it:

    <GRAPH_MIND_FOLDER>/log/
      desktop.jsonl        <- only the desktop ever appends here
      laptop.jsonl         <- only the laptop ever appends here

Each line is one record (a memory, or one conversation turn), never edited, never removed. A file
has exactly one writer, so syncing cannot interleave two machines' writes, and a line half-written
or half-synced is simply not read until its newline arrives. Reading imports every device's new
lines into the local index, in the order they were written, so a memory on the laptop can
supersede one written on the desktop: by then both are in the same database.

The index lives outside the folder and can be deleted at any time; `sync` rebuilds it.

The same log can live in Postgres instead of a folder ("memory_folder": "local" or a postgres://
URL). A synced folder reaches other PCs when the sync client gets round to it, often a minute
later; a Postgres table is there the moment the row commits, so a PC asking right after another
answered already sees it. "local" runs Postgres on this PC (fetched once, no setup); other PCs reach
it over Tailscale with its postgres:// URL. Rows are only ever inserted, one writer at a time
(an advisory lock), so reading by sequence number never skips a row committed late.
