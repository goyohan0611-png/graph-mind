"""Facts that change: the value now first, what it was before beside it.

The model records a fact with `about` and `attribute`; a later value of the same fact replaces
the earlier one in recall without the model knowing the earlier memory's id, and the order is
when each became true, so a fact recorded late from an old conversation stays history.
